# Analysis of the German charging points infrastructure
A published and freely accessible dataset from bundesnetzagentur.de was extracted and prepared for further analysis as part of a data wrangling process.
The dataset was then analyzed and visualized using Tableau to create a dashboard that will be updated monthly.

## Motivation / Goal
  ### Why does the project exist?
  - This project was carried out to practice all steps of a data analysis with a real world dataset
  - As a part of my continuing education becoming a data analyst

  ### Which steps of a data analysis process was practised?
  - Dataset extraction from an internet resource
  - Discovery / Exploration of the dataset
  - Data cleaning and transformation
  - Loading to databases
  - Visualization of the data
  - Creating an interactive dashboard

  ### Which tools where used?
  - python (pandas, sqlalchemy)
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Tableau

  ### What results does the analysis and its visualization provide?
  - Total number of charging points in Germany and the figures for annual expansion (trend)
  - How many charging points are normal charging devices or fast charging devices
  - the current status of the charging points
  - the total rated power in kW
  - Germany-wide coverage with public charging points
  - and the interactive filter option by historical extent, “federal state”, “district/independent city”, “location” and “operator”
